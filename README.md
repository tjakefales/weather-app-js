# weather-app-js
Very basic weather app using the Open Weather Map API. Type in a city in the search bar, hit enter, and it should give you 
the temperature, current weather, and the high and low temperature for the day. 


This project was based off of Tyler Potts's "Build a Weather app using HTML, CSS & JavaScript in 2020" video on YouTube.
